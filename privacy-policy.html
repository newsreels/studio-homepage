                                        were last updated; (2) your use of the Services is governed by such Business’s
                                        agreement with Frame.io; and (3) Frame.io may provide your personal information
                                        to such Business. If you are a Business User with Entitlements from multiple
                                        Businesses, you may have separate Business Profiles associated with each
                                        Business. As a Business User, you may have different agreements with or
                                        obligations to a Business, which may affect your Business Profile or your
                                        Content. Frame.io is not responsible for any violation by you of such agreements
                                        or obligations. If you did not receive Entitlements from a Business (e.g., you
                                        purchased an individual plan and received Entitlements through this plan), then
                                        (a) you are a “Personal User”; (b) your Frame.io profile is a personal profile;
                                        (c) you maintain sole access and control over all User Content in your personal
                                        account or personal profile (except as otherwise indicated in the Privacy
                                        Policy); and (d) all references to “you” in these Terms of Service will mean you
                                        as an individual. If you received Entitlements through a personal plan and from
                                        a Business, then you are both a Personal User and a Business User. You are a
                                        Personal User when you utilize the Entitlements you obtained through your
                                        personal plan, and you are a Business User when you utilize your Entitlements
                                        provided by a Business. </li>

                                    agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally and in good faith by contacting
                                    us and providing a written Notice of Claim to the address provided below in the
                                    Contact Section. The Notice of Claim must provide Frame.io with fair notice of your
                                    identity, a description of the nature and basis of your Claim, and the relief you

                                    and cannot be combined with a Notice of Claim for other individuals. If any dispute
                                    related to your Claim is not resolved within sixty (60) days of receipt, any
                                    resulting legal actions must be resolved through either small claims court or final

                                    for the dispute, subject to the exceptions set forth below. Neither party shall
                                    initiate legal action until 60 days after the Notice of Claim is received. This
                                    agreement to arbitrate shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or
                                    were asserted before the effective date of the Terms. The arbitrator, and not any

                                    court, the other party may provide notice that it wants the case decided in small
                                    claims court before the appointment of an arbitrator, and the arbitrator shall
                                    administratively close the case before assessing any fees, and the party bringing
                                    the Claim must proceed in small claims court in lieu of arbitration. Any dispute
